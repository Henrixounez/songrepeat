I walked into the desert
I walked out of the past
You were riding on a black horse
To sing the songs at the table, again
I walked into the desert
I walked into the dawn
And you came to me on the black horse
To remind all I've said and done
Be lightweight when I roam
Be lightweight when I go
Be lightweight when I roam
Be lightweight when I go
Roam
Roam
